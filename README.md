# Concerto UI Library

This library providers web UI components for models written in the [Concerto Modelling Language](https://github.com/hyperledger/composer-concerto).

<!--[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/accordproject/composer-form/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/accordproject/composer-form?branch=master)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/accordproject/composer-form.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/accordproject/composer-form)--> 

The Concerto Modelling Language is used by both Hyperledger Composer and Accord Project Cicero as an object-oriented data description (schema) language, based on a textual domain-specific language. Both communities would benefit from improved tooling for the modelling language, including the ability to generate UML style diagrams and web-forms from class descriptions described using the Hyperledger Composer modelling language.

## Web Form Generator

A web-form generated from model types would allow transactions to be submitted (or assets/participants created) by filling out a web-form, as opposed to submitting JSON formatted text, easing ease of use and guiding the user. The web form generator dynamically creates form elements based on a root type from a Concerto model. Some simplifying assumptions are made to solve the issue of data-binding from arbitrarily complex object models to web forms. The generated web form generator is an embeddable, modular, component that can be easily embedded in web-based tools, such as Hyperledger Composer Playground, or similar.

## How this project is structured

Packages: 
- `concerto-ui-core`, includes the base visitor class and utility functions
- `concerto-ui-react`, extends the base visitor to provide a ReactJS form
- `concerto-ui-demo`, uses the react visitor and applies SemanticUI styling
